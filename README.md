# 🌍 Explorer – Your Personal Travel & Itinerary Agent

Explorer is an intelligent travel assistant that plans your perfect day out — tailored to your interests, location, budget, and schedule.

Whether you’re looking for a scenic run, a tech event, a cozy dinner spot, or a full-day adventure, Explorer handles all the planning. Just tell it what you want to do, and it’ll generate a personalized itinerary with real locations, routes, and times — all optimized for your day.

	•	🕐 Time- and date-sensitive: Takes into account your available time window and the day of the week
